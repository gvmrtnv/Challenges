To brush up on my statistics skills and satisfy my analytical curiosity, I regularly solve data science puzzles and challenges.
This repository is a collection of my solutionsâ€”ranging from classic problems to more exploratory data investigations.

Feel free to browse through, get inspired, or reach out if you spot a mistake. Feedback and discussion are always welcome!
